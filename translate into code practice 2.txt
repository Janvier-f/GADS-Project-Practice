# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## Objectives
 
  - Initialize App Engine

  - Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell

  - Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it
  
  - Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible

 # steps:

 1.Activate Google Cloud Shell

   1.You can list the active account name with this command:

        gcloud auth list

    2.You can list the project ID with this command:

        gcloud config list project

 Task 1: Initialize App Engine

       1.Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

           gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
        
       2.Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
  
           git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

       3. Navigate to the source directory:

           cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

Task 2: Run Hello World application locally

     1.  Download and update the packages list

          sudo apt-get update

     2.Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.

          sudo apt-get install virtualenv

       If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.

        virtualenv -p python3 venv

     3.Activate the virtual environment.

       source venv/bin/activate

     4.Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

       pip install  -r requirements.txt

     5.Run the application:

       python -c 4 main.py

Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

     1.Navigate to the source directory:

        cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

     2.Deploy your Hello World application.

        gcloud app deploy

    If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.

     3. Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

              gcloud app browse
